## Hypercert Improvement Proposals (HIPs)

Hypercert Improvement Proposals (HIPs) are intended for collaborative community input on what should be improved, tweaked, built, supported, or simply worked on for the hypercerts protocol, marketplace, apps, and it's role in the interconnected impact funding ecosystem.

While we are excited to have a more formal process to hear ideas from the community (roughly inspired by the more decentralized PEP, BIP and EIP processes - and in the case of HIPS mostly [DIPS](https://github.com/efdevcon/DIPs/)), this is an experiment, and it should be understood that approval of proposals ultimately lies solely with the hypercert team. HIPs focus on collaboration in the ecosystem, so please review [HIP-0](HIPs/HIP-0.md) and try to collaborate on other proposals before submitting your new HIP. _We're excited to see all of your great ideas!_
